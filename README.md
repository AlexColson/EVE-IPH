# EVE-IPH
Code for the EVE Isk per Hour program

I'm looking for someone to take over updating this program for the EVE community in a few months as I'll be moving on from the game. Your level of involvement is up to you but I'd like to find someone that could at a minimum continue to update the databases and fix data issues if they come up.

Skills required
- VB.net
- SQL (SQLite)
- Git

Familiar with
- JSON
- YAML
- XML
